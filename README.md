# POPF-Predictor
Binary classifier for predicting POPF - code PLUS trained and externally validated model 


# Installation 


The POPF predictor has been tested on MacOS (Monterey, Version 12.6) and Windows 11. We do not provide support for other operating systems.

The POPF predictor does not requires a GPU. For training, we recommend a strong CPU. At least 6 CPU cores (tested on 6-Core Intel Core i5).

We very strongly recommend you install the POPF predictor in a virtual environment. 

Python 2 is deprecated and not supported. Please make sure you are using Python 3.
